I’m a **CS student** currently in my last year of study at **IIIT Jabalpur, India**. Currently I’m interning as a **Data Scientist at NeenOpal Inc.**, where I am working as a part of the forecasting team to make predictions for one of the largest tile manufacturing organization in Sri Lanka. 

**When I’m not working at the screen**, I’m either banging my head to heavy metal, chilling out with hiphop/R&B songs, or write about my opinions over various music albums and bands on my second blog [here](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/thoughts/).
